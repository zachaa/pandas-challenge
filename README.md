# Challenge 4 - Pandas

This repo contains a jupyter notebook for analyzing high school passing rates by a variety of methods including school size, budget, and school type.

## PyCitySchools

The data from two csv files is imported and analyzed in [PyCitySchools_main.ipynb](/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_main.ipynb). The below analysis is also included at the start of the notebook.

### Analysis

The data shows that overall, school size has a significant effect on passing rates. Small and medium sized schools have an overall passing rate of about 90% while large schools have a passing rate of about 58%.

From the analysis of the data we can see that spending more money per student does not improve test scores or passing rates. The data shows that the higher per student spending corresponds with a lower overall passing rate.

Overall, charter schools have significantly higher passing rates than district schools. Even though both types of schools have similar average scores (especially in reading), the district schools have a much lower passing rate. This would imply a larger variance in scores at district schools, but we would need to do further analysis to confirm this.

To make a more complete analysis on the above effects, we would need more information. The most useful may be knowing the number of teachers at each school to determine the student to teacher ratio, or having the average class size.
